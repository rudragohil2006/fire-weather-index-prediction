# Overview
An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI)
Helps assess forest fire risk based on weather and environmental conditions
Includes complete pipeline: data preprocessing → model training → deployment
Deployed locally using a Flask web application

# Objectives
Build a regression model to predict Fire Weather Index
Implement a real-world ML workflow
Provide a clean and user-friendly web interface
Follow industry-standard project structure

# Machine Learning Details
Problem Type: Regression
Algorithms Used: Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
Final Model: Ridge Regression
Preprocessing: Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
Model Persistence: Pickle (.pkl files)

# Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Web Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Tools: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
Deployment: Render

# Input Features
Temperature (°C)
Relative Humidity (%)
Wind Speed (km/h)
Rainfall (mm)
Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)
Duff Moisture Code (DMC)
Initial Spread Index (ISI)
Fire Occurrence Class (0 = No Fire, 1 = Fire)
Region (0 = Bejaia, 1 = Sidi Bel Abbes)

# Application Workflow
User enters meteorological data through the web form
Inputs are validated and scaled using a saved scaler
Scaled data is passed to the trained ML model
Predicted Fire Weather Index is displayed on the UI
